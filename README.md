Part II: Personal Hello

Create a blank, valid html5 document.

Create a javascript file and include it with a script tag as before.

Use var, prompt, string literals, the + operator, and alert such that when the user opens the page, it will ask them for their name, and then respond with "Hello [YOUR_NAME]!"


BONUS

Repeat one of the parts above using yeoman along with the refactoru-html generator to scaffold out the initial files.
